# self-driving-car-simulator
Creating a web-based simulation for a self-driving car involves multiple steps. We'll develop a simple website that incorporates the car simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example will simulate the car's behavior on a canvas, illustrating how it navigates based on neural network inputs and sensor data.

Project Structure
Here's the basic structure of our project:

lua
Copy code
self-driving-car-simulation/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js

Explanation
Controls Class:
Handles keyboard input for manual control.

Sensor Class:
Placeholder for simulating sensors (e.g., LiDAR, radar).

Neural Network Class:
Placeholder for a simple neural network, with a mock feedForward method to generate random control outputs.

Car Class:
Implements the car’s physics, movement, and collision detection.

Initialization Code:
Sets up the canvas and animates the car's movement.

Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, open index.html in a web browser. You should see a canvas with a rectangle representing the car, which moves based on the control logic defined in the Car class.

This example provides a foundational structure. In a more comprehensive project, you would expand the Sensor and Neural Network classes to include real sensor data processing and neural network computation, respectively. You could also add more complex environment simulation with roads, obstacles, and other traffic.
